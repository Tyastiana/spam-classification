# Spam Classification

## Overview
This project analyzes and classifies SMS messages into **spam** and **non-spam** categories using the `spam.csv` dataset. We perform Data Understanding, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Text Preprocessing (tf-idf), Model Training (Logistic Regression), and apply a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate spam classification.

## AI Support Explanation
